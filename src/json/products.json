Find the best spot at the View Point Penanjakan and watch as the sun slowly casts light over its surroundings. If you're lucky, you might even see the Milky Way! Your journey doesn't stop there though, because as you descend the view point, you'll see more gems that the national park has to offer. Make way to many more photogenic spots, such as Bukit Cinta, Mount Bromo and its crater, the stunning vastness of Pasir Bercepat and the savanna. Don't forget to see the picturesque Bukit Teletubbies that will make you feel like you're in the middle of a fairy tale setting. If you're still up for more adventure, you can add a visit to the Coban Pelangi Waterfall to your itinerary! "
